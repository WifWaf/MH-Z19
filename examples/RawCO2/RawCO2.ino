/* 
  Raw CO2:
  Using the raw value competantly requires insight into the technology
  and science behind how such algorithms are produced. However, it
  can still be extremely useful to have a rough value as a 'sanity check'
  against MHZ19 calibration failure. This is because the raw is 
  not affect by span/range/zero/temperature.

  This can be achieved by plotting the Raw value vs CO2 ppm over a
  broad range when conditions are idealistic. This can be versus
  its own calibrated PPM.

  Using this relationship, a trend can be produced (an exponetial 
  trend is ideal for a 2000 range, otherwise polynomial)
  which can be applied to the raw value.

  While this is useful, it's important to remember that temperature
  and pressure both have an effect on PPM and that changes to these
  parameters will not reflect in your trend (although the difference
  is often very small).
